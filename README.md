# Skeleton for angular client + node server JS App

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `node init.js`

## Testing

Scripts for unit testing will be loaded (in both client and server) from {client|server}/test/mock first and then from
{client|server}/test/spec (directories which currently lack in their existence)
